Dr. T. Berry Brazelton has been called
our “national treasure.” Known and
beloved for his reassuring advice on the
universal issues of child care, he now
advises parents for the first time on major
family crises. Divorce and stepparenting,
infertility and adoption, life-threatening
illness in a child, the loss of one parent,
the single father, and issues of two cul-
tures in an adoption are all examined in
depth in this candid and gr« yund-breaking
book. Dr. Brazelton also explores two
other issues of special concern to two-
career couples — rivalry between the
parents for a child’s affection and the

role of a nurturing, actively involved
grandparent.

Drawing on the dramatic lives of five real
families, Dr. Brazelton shows how cach
crisis upsets the stability of a family, how
each member copes with the problem,

and most important, how they eventually

regain a balance and grow from the expe-

rience. An entire chapter is also devoted

to advice on when, why, and how an over-

whelmed family can seek help. Parents

everywhere, regardless of their situation,

will feel invigorated and strengthened by

this wise book.
